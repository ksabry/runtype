An attempt at a comprehensive description of the sound types in typescript
This is only for fully realized types, i.e. types with no generic parameters

	never - bottom type, subtype of all types
	unknown	- top type, supertype of all types
		primitive types
			number
				numeric literal (singleton)
				- Additional values with no associated literal
					Infinity, -Infinity, NaN
			boolean
				true (singleton)
				false (singleton)
		object types
		union types
		intersection types

	<...>   Type without a single associated identifier
	(...)   Comment on type
	=       Union of listed subtypes is equivalent to supertype
	V       Union of listed subtypes does not include all values of supertype

Object type literal   { ... }
	
	Assigning to, supertype check
		behaves as an object with the specified properties
		ALL unspecified properties, including properties on Object, typed as optional and of type unknown
		note that in some contexts you cannot assign to non-specified properties, they are effectively typed as optional and of type never
	
	Assigning from, subtype check
		behaves as an object with the specified properties; any properties not specified but present on Object inherit their type from Object
		any other unspecified property is typed as optional and of type unknown
